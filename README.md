# What is Bogwalker?

Bogwalker is a logic puzzle game inspired by Minesweeper. You look at numbers laid across a swamp and try to figure out where the crocodiles lie.


# Guide

Reveal tiles by clicking on them. The numbers tell you how many crocodiles there are within a radius of 5 tiles. If you step on a crocodile, you die. Mark where you think the crocodiles are by placing buoys. When you place a buoy the threat of a crocodile that would be on that tile is subtracted from the threat field. Win by marking all the crocodiles.


# Ideas

 * Monsters liking certain depths. Perhaps you know the depth of every tile from the get-go and can determine what kinds of monsters it could have.

# Progression

 * You are a mercenary in knight's armor, who carries trinkets and trophies given to him by the guild.
 * When you die, your trinkets and trophies are retreived by the guild and returned to the guild house.
 * Every run is a series of 4-5 puzzles, concluding with a boss puzzle (a ruin with a dragon with a special ability).
 * When you complete a run, you clear a path towards the citadel.
 * When you die, the path you cleared is filled with monsters again, but a tombstone is left to denote how far you got.
 * When you reach the citadel, you get a golden trinket from the mage who lives in it, and the ability to make the game harder (ascension mode).
