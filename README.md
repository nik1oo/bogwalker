# What is Bogwalker?

Bogwalker is a logic puzzle game inspired by Minesweeper. You look at numbers laid across a swamp and try to figure out where the crocodiles lie.

# Guide

Reveal tiles by clicking on them. The numbers tell you how many crocodiles there are within a radius of 5 tiles. If you step on a crocodile, you die. Mark where you think the crocodiles are by placing buoys. When you place a buoy the threat of a crocodile that would be on that tile is subtracted from the threat field. Win by marking all the crocodiles.

# Ideas

 * Monsters liking certain depths. Perhaps you know the depth of every tile from the get-go and can determine what kinds of monsters it could have.
