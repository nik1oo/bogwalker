# What is Bogwalker?

Bogwalker is a logic puzzle game inspired by Minesweeper. You look at numbers laid across a swamp and try to figure out where the crocodiles lie.

# Guide

Reveal tiles by clicking on them. The numbers indicate the threat level of each tile. Each crocodile adds to the threat level of tiles around it. The closer you are, the greater the threat. If you step on a crocodile, you die. Mark where you think the crocodiles are by placing buoys. When you place a buoy the threat of a crocodile that would be on that tile is subtracted from the threat field. Win by marking all the crocodiles.
